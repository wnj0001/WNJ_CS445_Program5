# Software Design Plan - CS445 Program 5

## Changes from Program 4

<!-- 1. The enemy objects will be filled boxes with lighting/illumination. -->

<!-- 2. The light source will be at position (0,0,0). -->

<!-- 3. The color of the light is white. -->

<!-- 4. The falling objects have a front face not closer than the z = -10 plane. -->

<!-- 5. The objects are strong specular reflectors -- and they have a strong diffuse aspect to them. -->

<!-- 6. Material properties must allow highlights to be seen. -->

<!-- 7. NOTE: Document all material properties in the Architecture Statement. -->
